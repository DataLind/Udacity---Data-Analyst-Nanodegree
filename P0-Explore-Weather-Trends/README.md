## P0: Explore Weather Trends

### Prerequisites

Additional installations: 

* [Missingno](https://github.com/ResidentMario/missingno)
* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/)

## Project Overview

This first project required the following steps:
* Extract data from a database using a SQL query
* Calculate a moving average
* Create a line chart 

I analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends in three german cities to overall global temperature trends. After some data cleaning I created a function to assist the data processing and visualization with some options to play around with. This included also the calculation of a simple linear regression to visualize trends.
