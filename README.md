# [Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002)

> Discover insights from data via Python and SQL.

## Skills Acquired (Summary)


### Prerequisites

You'll need to install:

* [Python (3.x or higher)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

And additional libraries defined in each project.

Or go the quick way by installing the Anaconda distribution:

* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section)

## Project Overview
### P0: Explore Weather Trends

This first project required the following steps:
* Extract data from a database using a SQL query
* Calculate a moving average
* Create a line chart 

I analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends in three german cities to overall global temperature trends. After some data cleaning I created a function to assist the data processing and visualization with some options to play around with. This included also the calculation of a simple linear regression to visualize trends.

### P1: Investigate a Dataset (Gapminder World Dataset)

In this project I learned all steps which are involved in a typical data analysis process. I posed questions and answered them after I gathered, cleaned and wrangled the data into an usable format. After that I communicated the results in several ways. 

Out of the project:

> This project will examine datasets available at Gapminder. To be more specific, it will take a closer look on the life expectancy of the population from different countries and the influences from other variables. It will also take a look on the development of these variables over time and the goal is to find trends which are related to a higher life expectancy.

>**What is Gapminder?**
"Gapminder is an independent Swedish foundation with no political, religious or economic affiliations. Gapminder is a fact tank, not a think tank. Gapminder fights devastating misconceptions about global development." (https://www.gapminder.org/about-gapminder/)

The biggest challenge here was to find and ask interesting and right questions. Also the fact that you have to inform yourself very intensely about the data to understand the outcomes got amplified strongly.

It was also interesting how important reusable code is, because it can make your analysis so much easier, readable and faster.

### P2: Analyze A/B Test Results

To goal of this project was getting experience with A/B testing and the difficulties and drawbacks of it. At first we learned what A/B testing is all about, then we learned different metrics like the Click Through Rate (CTR) and how to analyze these metrics properly. We also learned about the drawbacks like the novelty effect or change aversion. 

Overall we brought everything we've learned in the "Pracitcal Statistics" part together to analyze this A/B test properly (Probabilites, Hypothesis Testing, Sampling Distribution/Bootstrapping, Logistic Regression).

### P4: Communicate Data Findings
