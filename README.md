> Discover insights from data via Python and SQL.

## Skills Acquired (Summary)


### Prerequisites

You'll need to install:

* [Python (3.x or higher)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

And additional libraries defined in each project.

Or go the quick way by installing the Anaconda distribution:

* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section)

## Project Overview
### P0: Explore Weather Trends

This first "warm - up" project required the following steps:
* Extract data from a database using a SQL query
* Calculate a moving average
* Create a line chart 

I analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends in three german cities to overall global temperature trends. After some data cleaning I created a function to assist the data processing and visualization with some options to play around with. This included also the calculation of a simple linear regression to visualize trends.

### P1: Investigate a Dataset (Gapminder World Dataset)

In this project I learned all steps which are involved in a typical data analysis process. I posed questions and answered them after I gathered, cleaned and wrangled the data into an usable format. After that I communicated the results in several ways. 

The biggest challenge here was to find and ask interesting and right questions. Also the fact, that you have to inform yourself very intensely about the data to understand the outcomes got amplified with this project.

It was also interesting how important reusable code is, because it can make your analysis so much easier, readable and faster.
