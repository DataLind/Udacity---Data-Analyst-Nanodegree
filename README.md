## Project Overview
### P0: Explore Weather Trends

This first "warm - up" project required the following steps:
* Extract data from a database using a SQL query
* Calculate a moving average
* Create a line chart 

I analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends in three german cities to overall global temperature trends. After some data cleaning I created a function to assist the data processing and visualization with some options to play around with. This included also the calculation of a simple linear regression.

### P1: Investigate a Dataset (Gapminder World Dataset)

### P2: Analyze A/B Test Results

### P3: Gather, Clean and Analyze Twitter Data

### P4: Communicate Data Findings
