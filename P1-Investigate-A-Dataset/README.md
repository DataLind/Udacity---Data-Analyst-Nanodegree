### Wrangling

For the analysis, following countries were dropped out of the dataframe due to too much missing data:

- Andorra, Dominica, Holy See, Liechtenstein, Marshall Islands, Monaco, Nauru, Palau, San Marino, St. Kitts and Nevis, Tuvalu

### Summary

- We can observe an overall and ongoing uptrend for the world population, the income per person and the life expectation

- especially between 1950 and 1975 was a starting point for a strong increase in all three metrics

- the world population is increasing strongly and one observable reason for that is the increase in the overall life expectancy

- we also found out that there is a relationship between the income per person and the life expectancy. An increasing income is no guarantee for an also increasing life expectancy, but it is correlated
